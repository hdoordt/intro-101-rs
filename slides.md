# Why?

```rust
let mut reasoning = "Rust is great and all, but...".to_owned();
loop {
  reasoning.push_str("There aren't a lot of job openings, because...");

  reasoning.push_str("Companies are hesitant to adopt it, because...");

  reasoning.push_str("There aren't many experienced developers, because...");
}
```

We need to `break` this cycle!

# Why?

```rust
let mut reasoning = "Rust is great and all, but...".to_owned();

loop {
    reasoning.push_str("There aren't yet a lot of jobs, because...");

    reasoning.push_str("Companies are hesitant to use it, because...");

    reasoning.push_str("They can't find developers that have learned it, because...");
}
```

We need to `break` this cycle!
